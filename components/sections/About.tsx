						I started getting acquainted with Java in 2019. During that time, I taught myself some UI Frameworks like
						Angular, React.js, then Flutter, I have constantly grown and improved myself, always learning and
						cultivating new knowledge and technologies along the way. Currently, I am learning and have built some
						cutting-edge web and native applications using modern technologies such as Node.js, Next.js, TypeScript,
						TailwindCSS, Flutter and so on.

						When I&#39;m not in full-on development mode, you can find me through my social media, watching movies,
						playing games, or reading books. Sometimes I also like to go out and take some photos.
